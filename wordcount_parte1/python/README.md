# Word Count - Python

[word_count.py](./src/main/python/word_count.py) is the base of a Python program to solve the word count problem.

Before running, make sure you have [Python3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the dataset is ready (see below).

## Setting up the dataset

To configure the dataset, use the script [make_dataset.sh](../make_dataset.sh), from [2023.1/word_count](../):

```bash
./make_dataset.sh
```
## Running the word count

From [2023.1/word_count/python](/), you can run the program with:

```bash
python .python/word_count.py dataset
```

In this case, `dataset` is the directory where the dataset is located.
